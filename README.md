# CSC130GroupProject
"Our department requires each course to have a group project. You need to do this project in a group of 4 students. Create a program that uses at least one of the data structures you learn in this course. Several data structures are provided for you. You can find them by clicking "Exams and Project" on the course menu. The goal is giving students some experience of working together as a team, which is something esential in the software industry. Don't try to create something big and fancy. Just make something simple and straight forward.  For example, you can create a simple program to do course registration. The user can add courses, drop courses and list courses he is enrolled in. A set will be used to store the data. The members of the set are the courses the user are enrolled in. Set is chosen becasue a student should not enroll in the same course twice, and the courses are not in any order. Again, create something simple and make sure your program works." - Man-Chi Leung
